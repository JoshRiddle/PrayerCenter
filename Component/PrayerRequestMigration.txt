Migrating from the Prayer Requests component

If the Prayer Requests component is installed, you will see the Upgrade wizard
in the PrayerCenter Admin Cpanel console.  To "copy" existing prayer requests from the
Prayer Requests DB table to the PrayerCenter DB table, click the Apply button.

You should now see all prayer requests within the PrayerCenter View Prayer Listing.
